Modular Dock for StealthChanger

**NOTE: This is a pre-release.  Unless you know what you are doing please wait for the Manual and config to be completed as we will not offer support on these until such time both are complete and uploaded.**

This dock is a drop in type. The back plate will allow for you to adjust the tool to be at perfect 90, I'd recommend 1 degree forward just to keep the dock in place.  Magnets are 2x5s and are optional, but recommened.

See [TODO](TODO.md) before you commit to building these.
