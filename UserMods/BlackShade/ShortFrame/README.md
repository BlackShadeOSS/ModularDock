# ShortFrame

### **NOT TESTED FULLY YET!**

Modified left and right part of the frame so less Z space is used. Total Z height is reduced from 169.9mm* to 155.0mm*. Everything else stays the same. **But you need to use Tophat**

( \* measured between top extrusion and the crossbar )

## Support for these are not handled by the StealthChanger Team, and all docks must use the same height, DO NOT MIX AND MATCH
