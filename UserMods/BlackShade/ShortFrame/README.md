# ShortFrame

### **Not Tested with crossbar yet!**

Modified left and right part of the frame so less Z space is used. Total Z height is reduced from 169.9mm* to 155.9mm*. Everything else stays the same. **But you need to use Tophat**

### Using SB is supported only with special docking path which is in work. Dm me on discord if you want to use the SB. For now use mainly with DB and XOL

( \* measured between top extrusion and the crossbar )

## Support for these are not handled by the StealthChanger Team, it is handled by BlackShade on discord
##  All docks must use the same height, DO NOT MIX AND MATCH

### My discord: `blackshade`
